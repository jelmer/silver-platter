Codemod Protocol
================

The codemod protocol documentation has been moved to the main documentation.

Please see: `../codemod-protocol.md <../codemod-protocol.md>`_

That document contains the authoritative specification for writing codemods
that work with Silver-Platter, including:

* Command execution model
* Environment variables
* Exit codes and error handling  
* Result JSON format
* Debian-specific features
* Complete examples

For implementation details specific to Silver-Platter's internals, see
the codemod module in the source code at ``src/codemod.rs``.
